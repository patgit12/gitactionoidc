Error: Error: An error occurred trying to start process '/usr/bin/bash' with working directory '/home/runner/work/gitactionoidc/gitactionoidc/$ {{ inputs.work-dir }}'. No such file or directory

cause: in deploy.yaml I should have working-directory: ${{ inputs.work-dir }} instead of working-directory: $ {{ inputs.work-dir }}
